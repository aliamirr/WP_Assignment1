    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of the data. Databases can be used to store a wide variety of data, from simple lists of information to complex structures like multimedia files or financial transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two different types of database management systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables and enforce strict rules for data structure and relationships between tables. SQL databases use SQL as the primary language for querying and manipulating the data. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, do not use a fixed schema like SQL databases. Instead, they use a flexible data model that allows for the storage of unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data. NoSQL databases do not require predefined relationships between tables, and they use a variety of query languages, including SQL, for data retrieval and manipulation. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are the way they store and organize data, the structure of their schemas, and the languages used to query and manipulate the data. SQL databases are well-suited for complex transactions and structured data, while NoSQL databases are better for handling unstructured and complex data."

    "The following are some of the common DDL commands and their usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create new objects in a database, such as tables,\n",
    "    views, indexes, and procedures. For example, the following SQL statement creates a new \n",
    "    table called \"employees\" with columns for employee ID, name, and salary:\n",

    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "  id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "  name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "  salary DECIMAL(10,2)\n",

    "2) DROP: The DROP statement is used to remove existing objects from a database. For example,\n",
    "    the following SQL statement drops the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "3) ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing object in a \n",
    "    database. For example, the following SQL statement adds a new column called \"department\"\n",
    "    to the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "\n",
    "4) TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to delete all data from a table while keeping \n",
    "    the table structure intact. For example, the following SQL statement removes all data \n",
    "    from the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
