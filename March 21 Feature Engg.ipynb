    "Ordinal encoding and label encoding are both techniques used to transform categorical data into numerical data. However, there is a difference between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding is used when the categorical data has an inherent order or hierarchy to it. In this technique, each unique category is assigned a numerical value based on its position in the order. For example, if we have a dataset of T-shirt sizes with categories \"Small,\" \"Medium,\" and \"Large,\" we could assign \"Small\" a value of 1, \"Medium\" a value of 2, and \"Large\" a value of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding, on the other hand, is used when the categorical data has no inherent order. In this technique, each unique category is assigned a unique numerical value. For example, if we have a dataset of fruit types with categories \"Apple,\" \"Banana,\" and \"Orange,\" we could assign \"Apple\" a value of 1, \"Banana\" a value of 2, and \"Orange\" a value of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, ordinal encoding is preferred when there is an inherent order or hierarchy to the categorical data, while label encoding is preferred when there is no such order. However, the choice between the two depends on the specific problem and the characteristics of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a dataset of movie ratings with categories \"Excellent,\" \"Good,\" \"Fair,\" and \"Poor.\" Since there is an inherent order to the ratings, we could use ordinal encoding. However, if we were working with a dataset of movie genres with categories such as \"Action,\" \"Comedy,\" \"Drama,\" and \"Horror,\" we would likely use label encoding since there is no inherent order to the genres."

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on their relationship with the target variable. In this technique, categories are ranked in order of their effect on the target variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "1) Calculate the mean of the target variable for each category of the categorical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Rank the categories based on the mean value of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Replace the categories with their respective rank.\n",

    "- Miami: 5\n",

    "Replace the city names with their respective ranks in the \"city\" column.\n",

    "This technique is particularly useful when dealing with high cardinality categorical variables, which are challenging to encode using one-hot encoding or label encoding. Additionally, Target Guided Ordinal Encoding can help to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, which is desirable in some cases."
