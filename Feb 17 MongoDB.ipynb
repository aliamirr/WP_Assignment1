    "Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional relational database model of tables and columns. Instead, they use a variety of data models, such as key-value stores, document stores, graph databases, and others, which allow for more flexibility and scalability in handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",

    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where the data is unstructured or semi-structured, such as in social media feeds, sensor data, or e-commerce transactions.

Additionally, MongoDB is well-suited for applications that require real-time analytics or real-time updates, as it supports various features like indexing and aggregation."

    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that offers a range of features that make it useful for modern, high-performance applications. Some of the key features of MongoDB include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Document-Oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, which can have nested data structures, making it well-suited for storing and querying semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Schema-less: MongoDB does not require a predefined schema, which means that the structure of the documents can change over time without requiring changes to the database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) High Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers, making it highly scalable and reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) High Performance: MongoDB's native support for indexing, sharding, and other performance optimization features make it highly performant for both read and write operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Rich Query Language: MongoDB supports a rich query language that includes support for ad-hoc queries, indexing, aggregation, and geospatial queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Secondary Indexing: MongoDB supports secondary indexing, which allows for fast and efficient querying of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Replication: MongoDB supports replication, which allows for the creation of multiple copies of the data for redundancy and high availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Automatic Sharding: MongoDB supports automatic sharding, which allows for the distribution of data across multiple servers in a cluster, providing horizontal scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) Flexible Data Model: MongoDB's flexible data model allows for the storage of a variety of data types, including text, numbers, dates, and binary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) Easy Integration: MongoDB provides drivers and connectors for a variety of programming languages and platforms, making it easy to integrate with existing applications and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB's features make it a highly flexible and scalable database solution that is well-suited for modern, high-performance applications."
