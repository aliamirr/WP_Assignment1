    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are two fundamental concepts in probability theory and statistics that describe the probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The PMF is used to describe the distribution of a discrete random variable, which takes on a finite or countably infinite number of possible values. The PMF assigns a probability to each possible value of the random variable. In other words, the PMF gives the probability that a random variable takes on a specific value. The PMF is typically denoted by P(X=x), where X is the random variable and x is a specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the random variable X that represents the number of heads obtained from flipping a fair coin twice. The possible values of X are 0, 1, or 2. The PMF of X is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X=0) = 1/4\n",
    "P(X=1) = 1/2\n",
    "P(X=2) = 1/4\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The PDF, on the other hand, is used to describe the distribution of a continuous random variable, which can take on any value in a given interval or range. The PDF assigns a probability density to each possible value of the random variable. In other words, the PDF gives the relative likelihood of a random variable taking on a specific value. The PDF is typically denoted by f(X=x), where X is the random variable and x is a specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the random variable Y that represents the height of adult humans. The possible values of Y are any non-negative real number. The PDF of Y is given by a continuous function, such as the normal distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "f(Y=y) = (1/σ√(2π))exp(-(y-μ)²/2σ²)\n",
    "\n",
    "where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the distribution, respectively. The PDF describes the relative likelihood of an adult human having a height of y. For example, the PDF tells us that the probability of an adult human having a height of exactly 170 cm is zero, since the height can take on any non-negative real value. However, the PDF does tell us the relative likelihood of an adult human having a height between 160 cm and 180 cm, which can be computed by integrating the PDF over this range."

    "The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is a function that gives the probability that a random variable X is less than or equal to a certain value x.

    "\n",
    "F(x) = P(X ≤ x)\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF can be used to calculate probabilities of events involving the random variable X. For example, the probability that X falls within a certain range can be calculated by subtracting the CDF values at the lower and upper bounds of the range. The CDF can also be used to calculate percentiles of the distribution, which are values that divide the distribution into equal parts. For example, the 50th percentile, also known as the median, is the value of x such that F(x) = 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example to better understand the CDF. Suppose we have a fair six-sided die and we roll it once. The possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, each with probability 1/6. We can define the random variable X to be the outcome of the roll. The CDF of X is:\n",

    "F(3) = P(X ≤ 3) = (number of outcomes ≤ 3) / (total number of outcomes) = 3/6 = 0.5\n",

By knowing the CDF, we can calculate any probability of interest or obtain information about the distribution's percentiles.
