    "1) Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics is the branch of statistics that deals with the collection, organization, and summarization of data. It describes the basic features of data in a concise manner, such as measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of variability (range, standard deviation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A survey of a company's employees to determine the average age of the workforce. Descriptive statistics would be used to calculate the mean age of the employees, the range of ages, and the most common age group.\n",

    "2) Inferential Statistics: Inferential statistics is the branch of statistics that deals with drawing conclusions and making inferences about a population based on a sample. It involves using sample data to make predictions or generalizations about the larger population from which the sample was drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A political pollster takes a random sample of voters and uses inferential statistics to determine what percentage of the population would vote for a particular candidate in an upcoming election. The pollster would use inferential statistics to determine the margin of error and the confidence interval for the poll results."

Each level of measurement has its own set of appropriate statistical methods and tests, and using the wrong methods can lead to inaccurate or misleading results.\n",

    "For example, if a researcher is analyzing data on customer satisfaction levels using a Likert scale (e.g. strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree), the variable would be considered ordinal. In this case, using a mean or average to summarize the data may not be appropriate, as the numerical values assigned to each response category do not have equal intervals. Instead, a researcher might use a mode or median to summarize the data or use nonparametric statistical tests like the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare satisfaction levels across different groups.\n",

    "\n",
    "1) Mean: The mean is the sum of all the data points divided by the total number of data points. It represents the \"average\" value of the data. The mean is sensitive to outliers, so extreme values can affect the value of the mean. The mean can be used to describe the \"typical\" value of the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "3) Mode: The mode is the most common value in a dataset. It is used to describe the most frequent value or category in the data.\n",

    "4) Range: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. It gives an idea of how spread out the data is.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Variance: Variance is a measure of how spread out the data is around the mean. It is calculated by subtracting each data point from the mean, squaring the differences, adding them up, and dividing by the total number of data points. Variance can be used to describe how much the data deviates from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Standard deviation: Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is a measure of how much the data deviates from the mean. A small standard deviation means the data is clustered around the mean, while a large standard deviation means the data is more spread out. Standard deviation can be used to describe how much the data deviates from the mean."
