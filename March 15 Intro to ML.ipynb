    "    \n",
    "The training set is a subset of the dataset that is used to train the machine learning model. It contains input data along with the corresponding target or output variables (in supervised learning). The model learns from the patterns and relationships in the training data to make predictions or classifications. The training set is crucial for model training as it helps the model learn the underlying patterns and generalize to unseen data.\n",

    "    \n",
    "The test set is a separate subset of the dataset that is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. It consists of input data that the model has not seen during training. The test set is used to assess how well the model can generalize to new, unseen data and make accurate predictions. By evaluating the model on the test set, one can estimate its performance and understand how it is likely to perform in real-world scenarios.\n",

    "3) Validation Set:\n",
    "    \n",
    "The validation set is an additional subset of the dataset that is used to fine-tune the model and make decisions about its architecture or hyperparameters. It is used during the training process to evaluate the model's performance on data that it has not been directly trained on. The validation set acts as an intermediate checkpoint between the training set and the test set. It helps in monitoring the model's performance, detecting overfitting, and making adjustments to improve generalization.\n",
    "The importance of each term:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Training Set: The training set is vital as it provides the data for the model to learn the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. It helps in training the model's parameters or weights through optimization techniques, such as gradient descent. The training set is the foundation of the model's learning process.\n",

These algorithms aim to identify clusters or regions in the feature space where most of the normal data resides. Common algorithms used for anomaly detection include k-means clustering, Gaussian mixture models, or autoencoders.\n",

The anomaly score quantifies how different or dissimilar a data point is from the learned normal patterns. Various techniques can be used, such as distance metrics, density estimation, reconstruction error, or probability estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thresholding and Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "Set an appropriate threshold or cutoff on the anomaly scores to distinguish between normal and anomalous data. Data points with anomaly scores above the threshold are considered anomalies.

Fine-tune the model or adjust the threshold if necessary to achieve the desired level of detection accuracy.\n",
