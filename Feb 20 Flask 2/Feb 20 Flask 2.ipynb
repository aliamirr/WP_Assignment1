    "HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used for communication between web browsers and web servers. The two most common HTTP methods are GET and POST. Here's a brief explanation of each:\n",

    "GET method:\n",
    "\n",
    "GET is the most common method used in HTTP. When you type a URL into your web browser and hit Enter, your browser sends a GET request to the server hosting the website you want to visit. A GET request is used to retrieve data from a server. When you visit a website, the server sends a response back to your browser, which is displayed on your screen.\n",
    "The GET method sends data as part of the URL or query string. It is useful when you want to retrieve information from a server without changing any data on the server. GET requests can be cached, so they are faster than POST requests. However, GET requests have a limit on the amount of data they can send.\n",
    "\n",
    "POST method:\n",
    "\n",
    "The POST method is used to send data to a server in order to create or update a resource. Unlike GET, POST requests do not send data as part of the URL or query string. Instead, data is sent in the request body. POST requests are used when you want to create, update, or delete data on a server.\n",
    "POST requests cannot be cached and are slower than GET requests. However, they can send much larger amounts of data than GET requests.\n",

    "In Flask, the request module is used to handle incoming client requests made to the Flask web application. It provides a way to access and manipulate the data sent in a client request, such as form data, query parameters, headers, and cookies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The request object is a global variable in Flask that is available within the context of a request handling function. It contains various methods and attributes that allow you to access the data and metadata associated with the client request. For example, you can use the request.form attribute to access form data submitted via a POST request, or the request.args attribute to access query parameters submitted via a GET request.\n",

    "3) Accessing headers and cookies sent with the client request\n",
