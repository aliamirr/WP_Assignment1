It is a robust measure of central tendency that is less sensitive to outliers, making it useful for datasets with extreme values. To find the median, the dataset is first arranged in order from lowest to highest, and then the middle value is found. If there are an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",

In some cases, a dataset may have multiple modes, if there are multiple values that occur with the same highest frequency.\n",
