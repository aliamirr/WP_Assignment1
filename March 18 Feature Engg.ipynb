    "The filter method is a feature selection technique that involves selecting a subset of features based on some statistical measure, such as their correlation with the target variable or their variance.

    "The Filter method for feature selection has several drawbacks, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Lack of consideration for feature interactions: The filter method only considers the individual relevance of each feature with the target variable, but it does not consider the interactions between features. Therefore, it may fail to capture important feature dependencies that could improve model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Inability to handle redundant features: The filter method may select multiple features that are highly correlated with each other, leading to redundancy in the feature set. This redundancy can increase the model's complexity and lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Model dependence: The filter method is model-agnostic, meaning it does not take into account the specific model that will be used for training. As a result, it may select features that are irrelevant to the particular model being used, leading to suboptimal model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Limited feature space exploration: The filter method only examines the marginal distribution of each feature and the target variable, and may not be able to capture complex feature relationships that could improve model performance.\n",

    "5) Sensitivity to feature scaling: The filter method can be sensitive to the scale of the features, and features with larger scales may dominate the selection process, even if they are less relevant to the target variable.\n",
